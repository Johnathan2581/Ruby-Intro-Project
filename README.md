# Ruby-Intro-Project
This is my first Ruby project! ðŸŽ‰

The program asks for the userâ€™s first name, last name, city, and province. It then formats the input by:

Capitalizing the first and last name.

Capitalizing the city name.

Converting the province to uppercase.

Finally, it prints everything back in a clear, formatted way.

ðŸ§  What I Learned

How to use print and puts to interact with users.

How to collect input with gets.chomp.

The difference between methods that return a new string (like .capitalize) and methods that change the string in place (like .capitalize!).

How to use string interpolation (#{variable}) to insert values into output.

Basic Ruby syntax and running a script from the terminal.
